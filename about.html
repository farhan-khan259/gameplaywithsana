    <!-- WHAT IS FLYING CHESS -->
    <section class="offerings">
      <h2>What is Flying Chess?</h2>
      <p>
        Flying Chess (also known as Aeroplane Chess) is a classic multiplayer
        board game that combines logic and strategy. Played by 2 to 4 players
        using dice and tokens, the goal is to race your pieces from the base to
        the finish line while blocking or overtaking opponents. We’ve elevated
        this traditional game into a competitive, skill-based tournament format.
      </p>

    <!-- WHY WE STARTED -->
    <section class="offerings">
      <h2>Why We Started Chess Master</h2>
      <p>
        Pakistan is full of talented individuals who enjoy classic games but
        lack structured platforms to compete. Chess Master was created to change
        that — providing a space where everyone can participate without
        financial barriers, and where strategy and skill are celebrated.
